add ellipse (orthogonal only at first)   --done
template selector   --done
improve ALL function plotting: --done
	a better replace method, so that stuff like tan(x) can be used properly.










Functions that are finished but the HACKMD description isn't completed yet:-----------------------------------------------------
display()
ellipse()
slope_field()
polygon_rc()
polygon_ri()
polygon_rs()
polygon_rv()

can't draw on top of drawimage()

la_line_pp()
la_rectangle()

line_ps()
n_derivative()

magnify()

dist2D()
dist3D()
toRAD()
toDEG()

setcanvas() now has transparent background option.

remove all traces of downloadcanvas() from HACKMD.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


CSS update of all pop-up inserters. --done
Update all function to HACKMD.
Reset timeline

**Add Madoka "hope-despair-love" and EVA "reality and dream" to HACKMD page. --done

**Use <datalist> for function format hinter in the future.

static image / animation button "hover gray" function doesn't work.  (2022/6/29)  It seems like there is no solution. (2022/7/1) Well, I don't need that anyway. (2022/7/4)

**why can't setcanvas() change background transparency?.

_system_display:  Running timelines. --done

a checkbox for disabling _system_display()

add line_pp_ext()
add bc_init()
add arbitrary_point polygon
add arrow function

ezplot series are not stable enough, some cracks appear on the graph.

all functions: when start = end, simply do nothing.

default values for many functions, so they can be used more easily.

***template files move into .json. 

***Animation arranger Window

*weird margin appearing on quick_calculator's buttons.


fetch('https://wish-lin.github.io/Iridium/other%20stuff/demo/cross.txt')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(data => {
  	// Do something with your data
  	console.log(data);
 });
 

possible far future improvement: multiple <canvas> layers

todeg
torad
dist3D function
dist2D open for user use

optimize closePath()
optimize PI to Math.PI        not necessary (2022/7/13)

forbid mobile access??
forbid tablet access as well.


**change to AGPLv3 license

arrow_pp() atan2 optimization???

[Dangerous]plotting function last segment can have different length, so that the increment doesn't have to be precise?? Maybe add this in far future.

remove or modify drawimage()

**all inserters change to draggable <div>s using <iframe>


timelines doesn't go through start (frame 1), a small placement error of step-adding code.



//行政問題
use github docs instead of hackmd??
**change name when I move to v2. FNGplot (Faust & Gretchen)
buy custom domain??
release complete offline version???
