Ordinary differential equations


//Watch out,these might be future bugs
	float/float error compensation implemented from v0.9.7 onwards
	
	the bug of ezplot() drawing vertical "asymptotes" when plotting tan(x) and other similar functions is fixed by eliminating that line forcefully, so the
	plotting will suck under those cases when the increment is too big now. A huge chunk of the function will be missing. from v0.9.8 onwards
