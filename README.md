## What is Iridium?
**Iridium** is an open-source, Javascript-based math plotter & animator that can satisfy most precalculus and some basic calculus plotting needs. 

Iridium is conceived, developed and maintained by 林韋旭(Wish Lin) starting from April 2022 as a free and easy to use alternative to professional softwares such as **MATLAB** (In the field of plotting only, of course).

## The purpose of this project

After the COVID-19 pandemic, online courses, along with the convenience it brings to both students and teachers alike, are getting more and more attention around the world. Under such circumstances, it is forseeable that the demand in online math courses will rise as well, thus, creating a tool that anyone can get their hands on, understand, and produce high quality math images & animations for educational purposes has never be this important.
